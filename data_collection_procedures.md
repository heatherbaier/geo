# Data Collection and Cleaning Procedures

Important note on data collection: **GEO only collects school-level data!** Do not download, save or clean aggregated data.

### 1. Save the data & the link to the data
Before you start cleaning, save any original data files to the data/{ISO-3c} folder. If a fodler doesn't exist for the country you are working on, make one. Save *all* of the original data here. Create or add to the file metadata/{ISO-3c}.txt information about your data. This file should be formatted such that the name of the file is on line X and then the line immediatley beow it should be indented 1 tab and should ocnatin the exact link to where you got the data. The line imediatley below that should be again indented 1 tab and should be the data you retrieved teh file in teh format MM/DD/YYYY. See other files in metadata/ for examples.
