description: >
  Core geospatial table for Belize schools, including unique OEDC IDs, Ministry of
  Education identifiers, names, addresses, administrative boundaries, and coordinates.
  Covers all public schools and state-subsidized government-aided schools. Excludes fully private schools, except those specially-assisted
  schools which are flagged as private_subsidized.
source: >
  Belize Ministry of Education EMIS school list (most recent available),
  Education & Training Act (Cap 36:01) definitions for "government" and "government-aided"
  schools, and Ministry sector documentation.
school_inclusion_criteria: >
  Schools were included if their Sector was:
    - "Government" (fully public)
    - "Government Aided" (denominational/community schools with government-paid teachers)
  Schools were excluded if their Sector was "Private" or "Specially Assisted". This approach aligns with national policy,
  which treats Government and Government-Aided schools as part of the public system
  (publicly funded, government-paid teachers, open enrollment under catchment rules).
